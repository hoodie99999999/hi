 <p class="ed">
 I had attended 4 different school just in the basic Education years. The reason was 
 for the first school, the school is a girl only school and the boys can only attend 
 till grade 4. at the second school for some kind of personal reason i tramfer to 
 the private school. I got a fight with one student before the grade 10 start.
 So I tranfered to another school. From that school, I finished matriculation exam 
 with the pass marks. i got History major (distance) in EYU and attended it for 1 year before
 the covid start. During attending EYU first yr, I also attent Tourism and Hospitality Diploma.
 And i now joining Gusto Foundation class and it is almost finish.
